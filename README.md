# Wheel Experience

A basic reimpl of Stake's wheel game.

Implemented with [excalibur.js](https://excaliburjs.com/docs/).

Goals:

- Accumulate more demo games, esp ones simpler than dice-experience.
- See what it's like to maintain a multitude of caas servers.
- Test out excalibur as a basic game loop abstraction.

Usage:

```sh
npm run dev
npm run build
```
